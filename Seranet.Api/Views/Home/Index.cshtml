        <h2>Create New APIs</h2>
        <p>Writing new Seranet APIs is fairly straight forward. The codebase is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/ectechno/seranet.api"> github </a>
        for you to fork on to your own GitHub account. Once locally cloned, you should be able to run Seranet.Api MVC5 project through VS2013 and do modifications to existing APIs. 
        </p>
        <p>To create new APIs, add a new Code Library project to the solution having nuget dependency to 'Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Core'. Next add your new
        project as a dependency to Seranet.Api host project. Now you are ready to add your WebApi controllers to your project. These controllers will be
        automatically pickedup and be deployed by the Seranet.Api host project.</p>

        <p>Once development is complete send your work as a 'Pull Request' to the original 'ectechno' repository.
         Someone will soon attend and deploy that to production :) !!!</p>

        <h2>Using the Service APIs</h2>
        <p>All Seranet Service APIs are based on REST model, allowing developers to easily consume services across different platforms. 
        JavaScript SPA is a common usecase for writing modern 99XT internal applications. </p>
